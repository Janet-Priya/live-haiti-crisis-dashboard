# ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡¹ Haiti Crisis Data Dashboard  

## A Real-Time View into Haitiâ€™s Humanitarian Emergency  

The **Haiti Crisis Data Dashboard** is a live, data-driven visualization tool that tracks and analyzes the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Haiti.  
By combining open-source event data, geospatial insights, and AI-assisted analytics, this platform sheds light on patterns of violence, displacement, and instability â€” transforming raw data into clarity and awareness.

---

## Purpose  

Haiti continues to face compounding crises â€” from political instability and gang-related violence to economic disruption and displacement.  
This dashboard aims to monitor, visualize, and communicate key crisis indicators, enabling researchers, journalists, and humanitarian organizations to:  

- Track reported incidents and conflict trends in near real-time  
- Identify hotspots and emerging risks across regions  
- Understand severity patterns and humanitarian impact  
- Support data-informed decision-making and rapid response  

---

## Features  

- Dynamic filtering to explore incidents by type, date, severity, and location  
- Live metrics showing totals, averages, and trends updated daily  
- Interactive maps for visualizing conflict and displacement patterns  
- Multi-language support (English, French, Haitian Creole)  
- Automated data harvesting via GitHub Actions and Google API  

---

## Data Sources  

- Verified open-source reports from humanitarian and media feeds  
- Aggregated datasets compiled through automated scripts (`harvester.py`)  
- Geocoding and mapping powered by Google Geolocation API and Geopy  
- Data processed with Pandas, NumPy, and visualized using Plotly  

> All data used is publicly available and intended solely for humanitarian research and awareness purposes.

---

## Automated Data Updates  

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/harvest.yml`) that automatically:  
- Runs the harvester script every 24 hours  
- Updates the local database (`reports.db`)  
- Commits and pushes the latest dataset to the repository  

**Current Schedule:**  
`0 0 * * *` â†’ Every day at 00:00 UTC

## Harvester Workflow

The **harvester script** collects and stores structured event data into `reports.db`.  
It runs autonomously with minimal maintenance, logging key updates and changes in the dataset over time.

---

## Future Plans

- Integrate satellite or mobility data for humanitarian access mapping  
- Expand Haitian Creole translations across the interface  
- Add predictive analytics for early-warning indicators  
- Publish open dataset API for researchers and NGOs
